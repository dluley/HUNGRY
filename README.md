# HUNGRY

The idea for this app comes from struggling myself to find food at stores that are safe for my daughter to consume.
The goal for this project is to develop a tool that can be used to quickly identify if an item is safe for a user to consume or not, 
based on whatever dietary restrictions they may have. To accomplish this goal the first focus is on creating a more inclusive library
of products that are free of any of the 8 ingredients (milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish) that make up 
90% of all food allergy reactions. Next I would like to further expand the library to include product results that meet the needs 
of users with other types of dietary restrictions. When the project is closer to complete, I would like to include an image recognition
feature as well. The desired outcome here is to not only save time and effort for anyone living with dietary restrictions, but also to 
educate people about food allergies and dietary restrictions. With HUNGRY you can find all the food you CAN eat, regardless of what you can't.
